# SalonID Design - Multi-Step Form Application

## Overview
This is a Next.js 14 application for SalonID Design that provides a multi-step form interface for creating custom salon product designs. The application uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI components for the frontend, with Supabase for backend services and Twilio for SMS/OTP functionality.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and React 18
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **SMS/OTP**: Twilio
- **Email**: Nodemailer
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Key Features
- Multi-step questionnaire form for salon product customization
- Style selection (elegant/modern variants)
- Color scheme and palette selection
- Client details collection with OTP verification
- Admin dashboard for managing submissions
- Real-time form data context management

## Environment Setup
The application requires the following environment variables in `.env.local`:

### Supabase Configuration
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Server-side Supabase URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Service role key for elevated operations

### Twilio Configuration
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Twilio account identifier
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Twilio authentication token
- `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID`: Twilio Verify service ID

### Email Configuration

- `EMAIL_USER`: Email service username
- `EMAIL_PASS`: Email service password

## Development Workflow
The development server runs on port 5000 with the command:
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 5000 --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

## Database Schema
The application uses several database tables (SQL scripts available in `/scripts/`):
- `form_submissions`: Main form data storage
- `clients`: Client information and management
- `design_responses`: Design response history
- `email_otps`: OTP management for email verification
- `email_events`: Email event tracking
- `questionnaire_progress`: Progress tracking

## Deployment Configuration
- **Target**: Autoscale deployment
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Start**: `npm start -p $PORT -H 0.0.0.0` (Cloud-compatible)
